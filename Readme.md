# Blood Bank System
## Introduction
*Our Blood bank system solves a problem of people who need blood at urgent
bases as in our country there is a shortage of blood banks. If some organizations
sell blood so most of the people cannot contact them easily as there is no proper
mechanism for blood bank especially in government hospitals. People who are
injured in road accidents need blood at urgent bases. Some of the people who do
not have relatives in town and hospital do not have proper blood banks then or
BMS comes into play and plays a vital role in saving the lives of many people. Our
platform is directed to solve the problem for thalassemia patients who need
blood almost every week, so they also pre-book their donor at our site.*

## Purpose
*This project is created for all of those who want to have an emergency
back up for their blood needs. Each person can take an advantage of this
system whether being a client or donor. A client could be any person or
any organization who needs blood in case of emergency or to have kept
some blood in stock. Every connection between specific donor and client
is responsible for developing communication and dealing regarding the
blood supply.*
