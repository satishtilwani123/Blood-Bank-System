# Blood Bank System
**Introduction**
***Our Blood bank system solves a problem of people who need blood at urgent
bases as in our country there is a shortage of blood banks. If some organizations
sell blood so most of the people cannot contact them easily as there is no proper
mechanism for blood bank especially in government hospitals. People who are
injured in road accidents need blood at urgent bases. Some of the people who do
not have relatives in town and hospital do not have proper blood banks then or
BMS comes into play and plays a vital role in saving the lives of many people. Our
platform is directed to solve the problem for thalassemia patients who need
blood almost every week, so they also pre-book their donor at our site.***
